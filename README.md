## Dependencies
pyeditor needs the curses module to work:
```
pip install curses
```

Also, it optionally uses pyperclip for acessing the system clipboard
```
pip install pyperclip
```
If pyperclip is not found clipboard functions might not work correctly

## Help
You can press 'H' to access the help window.

## Bugs
Pyeditor currently does not support terminal window resizing.
